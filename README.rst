All the code for my thesis: Water property rights in regulated rivers.

Installation
============

Requires installation of python with packages: cython, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn and pandas. If you don't have python yet a good option is to install `Anaconda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/>`_.
